        This is a Python re-write of the CSIRO seawater toolbox
        (`SEAWATER-3.3 <http://www.cmar.csiro.au/datacentre/ext_docs/seawater.htm>`__)
        for calculating the properties of sea water. The package uses the
        formulas from Unesco's joint panel on oceanographic tables and
        standards, UNESCO 1981 and UNESCO 1983 (EOS-80).
        
        The EOS-80 library is considered now obsolete; it is provided here for
        compatibility with old scripts, and to allow a smooth transition to the
        new `TEOS-10 <http://www.teos-10.org/>`__.
        
        Warning
        -------
        
        The Python version default output unit for sw.dist is 'km' instead of
        'nm'.
        
        Here we assume pressure as the first dimension, i.e. M pressure by N
        positions (See the table below).  The MatlabTM version does some guessing
        at this that we simply ignore to avoid confusions.

        The current version was tested against the MatlabTM seawater v3.3 reproducing
        all functions and results from that release.

        Changelog
        ---------
        
        Version 3.3.3
        
        * Unified code base for python 2 and 3, we no longer use 2to3 to convert.
        
        Version 3.3.2
        
        * Fixed py3k bug that prevent installation.
        
        Version 3.3.1
        
        * Both `gpan` and `bfrq` accepts 3D arrays now.
        * Fixed inconsistency in use of ITS-90 and increased convergence precision from 1e-4 to 1e-10 for `cndr`. Note: Not sure if this fix is needed.  However, it is in the original version!
        
        Version 3.2
        
        * Corrected sign of potential vorticity in `bfrq`.
        
        Version 3.1
        
        * Added `swvel` to compute surface wave velocity.
        
        Version 3.0
        
        * Converted code so that temperature is now ITS-90 throughout.
        
        Version 2.0.2
        
        * Coding changes to enable functions to return the same shape vector as the input arguments.  In previous releases, some functions returned column vectors for row vector input.  Also some other tidying up.
        
        Version 2.0.1
        
        * New routine `satAr`.  Solubility of Ar in seawater.
        * New routine `satN2`.  Solubility of N2 in seawater.
        * New routine `satO2`.  Solubility of O2 in seawater.
        * Updated `test` to include tests for above.
        
        Version 1.2e
        
        * Fixed bug in `alpha` where temp used in calculations regardless of the keyword.
        
        Version 1.2d
        
        * `bfrq` now also returns potential vorticity.  Thanks to Greg Johnson (gjohnson@pmel.noaa.gov).
        * OMEGA=7.29e-5 was changed to OMEGA=7.292e-5 in `gvel` to be consistent with `f`.
        * **Important API change**: The usage of `alpha`, `beta` and `aonb` routines has changed!  All these routines expect (S,T,P) to be passed instead of (S,PTMP,P) as in previous releases of seawater.  Fast execution can still be obtained by passing ptmp=True.
        
        
        Version 1.2c
        
        * Fixed a bug in `bfrq` where empty LAT was needed as argument when no latitude values are being passed.
        * Now pass PRESSURE instead of DEPTH, more consistent though only a negligible change is answers.
        
        Version 1.2b
        
        * First official release and announcement on the networks.
